In summer 2023, I co-supervised several undergraduate researchers in their summer projects contributing to CliMA's [CloudyMicrophysics.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/CloudMicrophysics.jl) package. Among those projects were a new parameterization of terminal velocity, implementation of the P3 scheme for ice microphysics, and a machine learning and calibration pipeline for aerosol activation.
